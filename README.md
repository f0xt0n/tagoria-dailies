### A daily task completer for Tagoria, a browser fantasy RPG.

Auto-completes daily tasks including quests, plunders, and farming. Forever.

**FEATURES**::
- Quests - accepts, attempts, & turns-in quests by going to quest location and plundering.
- Plundering - plunders chosen location when out of Quest Points with remaining Action Points.
- Farming - farms for 24 hrs when out of Action Points until points reset at new day. Collects wages every 8 hrs.
- Skiller - increase attributes on levelup, buys skillpoints with extra amber above threshold.
- Amber Preserver - can set max amber carrying threshold if saving for weapons/armour/enchantments. Avoids carrying a large stealable sum by spending excess on skillpoints through Skiller.


**REQUIREMENTS**::
- Linux
- Firefox
- (Windows Only) Geckodriver - put exe in same folder as 'TagoriaDailies.exe' - [link](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases "GitHub")


**INSTRUCTIONS**::
1. (Optional but Recommended to increase speed & reduce bandwidth) Download Firefox extensions 'uBlock' & 'NoScript' (right-click "Add to Firefox" -> "Save Link As"). Rename files to 'ublock_origin.xpi' & 'noscript.xpi' and put them in the same folder as 'TagoriaDailies.exe'.
2. Enter credentials & edit preferences in 'config.yml'.
3. Confirm character is not currently taking an action. Logout.
4. Start 'TagoriaDailies_linux'.
5. Sit back & relax (or leave it running on a raspberry pi and forget about it for months 😅)

Notes:
- If using extensions, the action timers won't show by default. Open 'NoScript' in top right corner, trust 'tagoria.net', untrust every other URL.
- Don't click any link in-game while script is active as it will likely become confused on where it is and crash.
- If you encounter an error - logout, close browser, check instructions, restart script.


**DEVELOPMENT**::

Code is far from ideal, and is not hardened or self-healing if an error occurs.

Dependencies required for dev --
- Firefox
- Python 3.10.12
- Selenium 4
- Splinter 0.21
